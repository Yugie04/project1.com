        <p>My most memorable childhood event was when I was 15 years old. It was the Fourth of July. A big family vacation a barbeque, over night stay and out of town trip to six flags, and I had a blast the night before me, my mom, sisters and brother packed our bags to stay the night over my cousin house in Goodlettsville ,Tennessee. 
            She had the biggest house ever I thought it was a mansion; six bedrooms two an half bath,
            a swimming pool, a game/movie room with a nice big kitchen. It was something that I was not use,
            knowing that we stayed in a three bedroom based on an income apartment on the East side of Nashville.
            Arriving to my cousin house i seen alot of my family members even the ones that was from out of town.</p>
